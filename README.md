# Connect4

<img src= "https://github.com/tylerearl09/tylerearl09/blob/main/Connect%204.png"/>
The basic code for this project comes from a React tutorial found here: https://legacy.reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html
The tutorial was an introduction to React and created a tic-tac-toe game. I modified this code in order to create the 
Connect 4 game and implemented a high score table as well. This project was my intro to React and the MERN stack.
I learned the basics of React, and how to connect the frontend to a Mongo database and Node server.
